# Contributing to Awesome UCP

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! Whether you're fixing a typo, adding a new resource, or suggesting improvements, your help is appreciated.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository:** Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the GitHub page.

2. **Create a new branch:** Create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your changes separate from the main project until they're ready to be merged. A good branch name describes the changes you're making, e.g., `add-new-implementation` or `fix-typo`.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-new-implementation
   ```

3. **Make your changes:** Edit the `README.md` file with your additions or corrections. Please follow the existing format and style. When adding a new resource, make sure to include:

   * The resource name, linked to its repository or website.
   * A brief description of the resource's functionality or purpose.
   * Appropriate emoji indicators (if applicable) following the legend:
     * 🎖️ – official implementation
     * Programming language: 🐍 (Python), 📇 (TypeScript/JavaScript), 🏎️ (Go), 🦀 (Rust), #️⃣ (C#), ☕ (Java)
     * Scope: ☁️ (Cloud Service), 🏠 (Local Service)
     * Role: 🏪 (Merchant/Business), 🤖 (AI Platform/Agent), 💳 (Payment Provider)
   * Categorize the resource appropriately under the relevant section (e.g., Implementations, AI & Agent Integrations, Developer Tools, Learning Resources). If a new category is needed, please create one and maintain alphabetical order.

4. **Commit your changes:** Commit your changes with a clear and concise message explaining what you've done.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new XYZ implementation"
   ```

5. **Push your branch:** Push your branch to your forked repository.

   ```bash
   git push origin add-new-implementation
   ```

6. **Create a pull request:** Go to the original repository and click the "New pull request" button. Select your forked repository and branch. Provide a clear title and description of your changes in the pull request.

7. **Review and merge:** Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. They may suggest changes or ask for clarification. Once the review is complete, your changes will be merged into the main project.

## Guidelines

* **Keep it consistent:** Follow the existing format and style of the `README.md` file. This includes formatting, capitalization, punctuation, and emoji usage.
* **Alphabetical order:** Maintain alphabetical order within each category of resources. This makes it easier to find specific resources.
* **Accurate information:** Ensure that all information is accurate and up-to-date. Double-check links and descriptions before submitting your changes.
* **One resource per line:** List each resource on a separate line for better readability.
* **Clear descriptions:** Write concise and informative descriptions for each resource. Explain what the resource does and what its key features are.
* **UCP relevance:** Only add resources that are directly related to UCP (Universal Commerce Protocol). This includes implementations, tools, integrations, learning materials, and related protocols.
